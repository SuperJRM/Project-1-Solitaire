1. Progrmming Patterns Used:
    - I used a pretty simple state pattern which determined a card's state, such as when they would have shadows and when they are/aren't able to be grabbed. I chose to use this pattern as it made it easy to keep each cards behavior in chack, as only certain actions could be performed/states transitioned into from any given state.
    - I attempted to use the update method pattern, only placing parts of the code in update that needed to be updated every frame, like those dealing with the mouse's position. This was done to prevent overwhelming the code with concurrent processes each frame unneccessarily.
2. Postmortem:
    - I think I did well in terms of learning Lua and gaining a solid grasp on how it works and how it differed from other languages that I'm more familiar with. It was really fun slowly getting the hang of things and eventually coding in it like it was second nature. I definetely would've liked to have spent more time on this project, as I had a lot of fun trying to make an actual game from a new language. If I could go back, I would've definitely changed how I handled certain circumstances in other classes so that I could've been able to dedicate more time into fully realizing the game. I would've also liked to have used more patterns, like maybe some kind of flyweight, in order to simplify the code in terms of performance and readability.
3. Credits:
    - I based the code off of what was taught in lecture and during section, especially the vector.lua information.
    - All other code was made by me.
    - No external assets were used.
